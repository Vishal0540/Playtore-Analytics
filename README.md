# Play Store Analytics Project

## Overview

This project involves performing analytics on a Play Store dataset using Databricks. The main notebook, `segweise playstore.ipynb`, was utilized for the analysis. The dataset was manipulated within Databricks, and a Spark DataFrame was created for analysis. The final results were stored in a CSV file named `App Counts.csv`, which contains the counts of apps based on specified conditions.

## Assumptions

1. **Databricks Environment:** All the tasks were performed in a Databricks environment.


2. **CSV Corruption:** Due to data corruption or quality issues, some records from the original dataset were removed to ensure data integrity.

## Project Structure


  - `segweise playstore.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the PySpark code for Play Store analytics.
  - `App Counts.csv`: CSV file containing the counts of apps based on specified conditions.
